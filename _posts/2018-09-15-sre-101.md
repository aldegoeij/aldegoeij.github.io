And summarizing it [here](./2018-09-01-sre-book.md), I decided to write down some blueprint / 101 based on 'What Google says', based on my work at [New10](https://new10.com) as a member of their SRE team.

We are just 5 guys supporting a team of 30+ developers, so the below is focused on that.

# Glossary of Terms

You should probably read this first.

## Golden Signals

## Pages
Alerts from (production) systems / services. Should be based on (one of the) four golden signals.


# Monitoring

When attempting to monitor often changing systems / services, focus on getting the _four golden signals_ before anything else:



# The Team
Differentiate between **three types of work**:

* _On-Call_: Respond to _pages_. Perform root-cause analysis into _pages_. Design automation scenarios to prevent specific _pages_ from happening again.
* _Interrups_: Respond to 'customer' requests / tickets. Perform root-cause analysis into tickets. Design solutions to prevent specific tickets from being raised again.
* _Projects_: Build new things. This can be either work part of a product / service backlog, or from the SRE team backlog.

Differentiate between **three types of Engineer**:

* _Primary Engineer_: The weekly on-call Engineer, works on _pages_. When page load is **low**, works on _interrupts_.
* _Secondary Engineer_: Backup of the Primary. When ticket load and/or page load is **high**, works on _interrupts_, otherwise works on _projects_.
* _Engineer_: Works on projects. Might be pulled into _pages_ or _tickets_ when her expertise is needed, this should be minimized by having a cross-trained team, with e.g. playbooks or documentation for common issues.

_Side note:_ the _primary engineer_, if she is not busy with _pages_ or _interrupts_ has the perfect position to update documentation, clean-up stale tickets, merge-requests, etc.

_Another side note:_ in my team, _projects_ entail both work on stories from product teams as well as work on Engineering stories.
