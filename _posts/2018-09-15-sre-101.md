And summarizing it [here](./2018-09-01-sre-book.md), I decided to write down some blueprint / 101 based on 'What Google says', based on my work at [New10](https://new10.com) as a member of their SRE team.

We are just 5 guys supporting a team of 30+ developers, so the below is focused on that.

# Glossary of Terms

You should probably read this first.

## Pages
Alerts from (production) systems / services. Should be based on (one of the) four golden signals.



# Monitoring

When attempting to monitor often changing systems / services, focus on getting the _four golden signals_ before anything else:

**Latency:** time it takes to service a request: differentiate between successful and failed (error) requests. Definitely track both!

**Traffic:** how much demand is on the system: e.g. requests per second.

**Errors:** failure rate of requests: explicitly (`4xx` / `5xx`) or implicitly (`200` with wrong content).

**Saturation:** measure of system fraction: resource constraints / utilization. Measure 99th percentile over small window as early warning indicator. This is a predicting measure, so choose alert targets wisely!

If you measure all four golden signals correctly, and page a human when one or more signals are in alert, you will have decent monitoring coverage (without too many false positives).

Collect metrics by buckets, suitable for rendering a _histogram_. This will show distribution of e.g. request latency better and will ameliorate a useless average of request latency showing an acceptable number while some requests are incredibly slow.

# The Team
Differentiate between **three types of work**:

* _On-Call_: Respond to _pages_. Perform root-cause analysis into _pages_. Design automation scenarios to prevent specific _pages_ from happening again.
* _Interrups_: Respond to 'customer' requests / tickets. Perform root-cause analysis into tickets. Design solutions to prevent specific tickets from being raised again.
* _Projects_: Build new things. This can be either work part of a product / service backlog, or from the SRE team backlog.

Differentiate between **three types of Engineer**:

* _Primary Engineer_: The weekly on-call Engineer, works on _pages_. When page load is **low**, works on _interrupts_.
* _Secondary Engineer_: Backup of the Primary. When ticket load and/or page load is **high**, works on _interrupts_, otherwise works on _projects_.
* _Engineer_: Works on projects. Might be pulled into _pages_ or _tickets_ when her expertise is needed, this should be minimized by having a cross-trained team, with e.g. playbooks or documentation for common issues.

At any cost try to minimize the amount of interrupts to anyone but the primary or secondary engineer. Do not randomize / rotate ticket assignments. Context switches are the most costly and negative event in the day of an engineer.

When switching between on-call engineers, from one week to the other, have a formal, documented, hand-over moment in place. Not only does this bring the fresh engineer up to speed, it also allows for reflection on work done, it results in the fresh engineer being more productive and responsive, and the previous on-call engineer to have less interrupts after her shift.

_Side note:_ the _primary engineer_, if she is not busy with _pages_ or _interrupts_ has the perfect position to update documentation, clean-up stale tickets, merge-requests, etc.

_Another side note:_ in my team, _projects_ entail both work on stories from product teams as well as work on Engineering stories.
